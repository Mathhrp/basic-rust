# Rust Basic Programs

Welcome to this Rust repository, where you'll find a collection of basic programs written in Rust.
This project is aimed at those who are new to Rust or programming in general, 
offering simple examples to help understand the language's fundamentals.

## About Rust

Rust is a modern systems programming language focused on safety, speed, and concurrency.
It achieves memory safety without using a garbage collector,
making it a useful language for a wide range of applications,
from web servers to embedded systems.

## Repository Overview

In this repository, you'll find a variety of basic Rust programs,
each illustrating different aspects of the language, such as:

- Basic syntax and control structures
- Data types and their usage
- Functions and modular programming
- Collections and memory management
- Error handling and robust program design

Each program includes comments explaining the key concepts,
so you can understand not just how it works, but why it's written that way.

## Getting Started

To run these programs, you'll need to install Rust on your computer.
The easiest way to do this is through `rustup`,
which is Rust's official installer and version management tool.
You can download `rustup` and find installation instructions on the [official Rust website](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

Once you have Rust installed, you can clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mathhrp/basic-rust.git
cd basic-rust
```
To run a program, navigate to its directory and use cargo run, like so:

```bash
cd hello_world
cargo run .\hello.rs
```

This project welcomes contributions and suggestions. Dive into Rust and experience a new kind of systems programming!
